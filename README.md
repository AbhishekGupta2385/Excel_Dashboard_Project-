📊 Sales Analysis Excel Dashboard — Turning Numbers into Insights
Welcome to my Sales Analysis Project, where raw data meets meaningful storytelling. Built entirely in Microsoft Excel, this interactive dashboard is my way of showing how numbers can speak — when given the right voice.

🌟 Why I Built This
I created this dashboard to dive deeper into data and bring clarity to business questions like:

Which product is performing best?
Which region drives the most revenue?
How do sales channels compare over time?

As someone passionate about analytics and storytelling, I believe that data should not just be collected — it should be understood, explored, and acted upon.
